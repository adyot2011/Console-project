        <h2><u>Visual Studio Code</u></h2>
        <h4 class="blue">Visual Studio Code is a freeware source-code editor made by Microsoft for Windows, Linux and macOS. Features include support for debugging, syntax highlighting, intelligent code completion, snippets, code refactoring, and embedded Git. Users can change the theme, keyboard shortcuts, preferences, and install extensions that add additional functionality.
        </h4>
        <h2><u>Console in Google chrome</u></h2>
        <h4 class="blue">The Console is also a REPL. You can run JavaScript in the Console to interact with the page that you're inspecting. For example, Figure 2 shows the Console next to the DevTools homepage, and Figure 3 shows that same page after using the Console to change the page's title.</h4>
